Reasoning for model:
For the regression, I lagged the Airpassengers variable twice to deal with autocorrelation and logged the AirPassengers variable because the residuals didn't have constant variance. Residuals don't show any (major) problems now. 
There was a small improvement between using two lag variables; I decided to include the second one because it was still statistically significant.
